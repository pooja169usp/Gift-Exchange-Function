# Gift-Exchange-Function

## Instructions:

You are tasked with organizing a gift exchange among friends; every member of the group has 
to both give, and receive, a gift from among the others.
 
The only rule is that one can not receive a gift from the same person to whom they give a gift.
 
Write a solution for the above requirements for groups of varying sizes using Javascript. 
Remember to account for edge cases that would make the above rules impossible to follow.

example input:
['Susan', 'Beth', 'Abe', 'Ardi', 'Quan']
 
example output:
Abe gives a gift to Quan
Ardi gives a gift to Beth
Susan gives a gift to Abe
Quan gives a gift to Ardi
Beth gives a gift to Susan
